## Overview

This repository provides a minimal public reference for the research paper:

**“A Human-Centric, Lock-Governed Cyber–AI Unified Security Architecture”**

The work defines a system-level architecture in which cybersecurity, artificial intelligence,
automation, and robotic systems operate strictly under human authority,
lock-based governance, and infrastructure-level safeguards.

This repository intentionally contains **no executable code**.
